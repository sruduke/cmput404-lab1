Q2
I already had the requests library on my system, it was version 2.28.2.

Q3
Requests is not installed on the venv since it was just initialized. The version
on the venv is 2.31.0.

Q4
Not virtual environment python uses the system's global packages and
configuration to run programs. The virtual environment python, however, is a
minimal and isolated instance of python that is specific to a certain project /
program.

Q5
The status code `301 MOVED` is returned for `http://google.com`. After using `curl -i`, we could see that the document moved to `https://www.google.com`, which gives a 200 code.

Q6
curl with -i 
------------
The status code for `http://google.com/teapot` returned 301 'Moved Permanently'.

The curl returned the status code, the HTTP response headers, and the HTTP response, which contained HTML indicating the document moved to https://www.google.com/teapot.


curl with `-iL`
---------------
The initial status code was 301 'Moved Permanently', but then followed a
redirect to get the status code of 418 'I'm a teapot'.

The curl returned the status code, the HTTP response headers, and the HTTP response, which contained an HTML body containing references to the 'I'm a Little Teapot' song.

For https://www.google.com/teapot, I got 418 as the status code for both command
flags (-i and -iL).
 

Q7

Differences in output after using -X POST:
------------------------------------------
* The date header changed, specifically the time
* The HTTP response contained no form fields before, but now contains a form field; the data we passed was used in this field. 
* The presence of the above form field adds more fields to the HTTP response such as CONTENT_LENGTH and CONTENT_TYPE.
* The remote port for the former was 50314, while the latter has a remote port of 46022
* The request method for the former was a HTTP GET, while the latter is an HTTP POST
* They contain different unique IDs

An HTTP POST request is useful for providing data to a web server; it can be used to create, update, or upload resources, or perform other operations such as authentication.
